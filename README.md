# Advanced EDA Techniques in Python ‚Äì Jupyter Notebook Tutorial  

Welcome to the repository for **Advanced Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Techniques** in Python. This project demonstrates the use of correlation analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) to explore and simplify data effectively.  

---

## üìù Description  
In this tutorial, we work with a sample dataset to cover:  
1. **Correlation Analysis**:  
   - Understand relationships between variables.  
   - Select features for machine learning models.  

2. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**:  
   - Reduce dimensions while retaining essential information.  
   - Visualize data in lower dimensions.  

### Dataset Columns:  
- **Age**  
- **Gender**  
- **Education Level**  
- **Job Title**  
- **Years of Experience**  
- **Salary**

## üìÇ Files Included  
1. **`advanced_eda_techniques.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing all the Python code used in the tutorial.
